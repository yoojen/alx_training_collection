ALX CODING INSTRUCTIONS

```
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*)
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose
of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
```
